Code Architecture and Understanding Document
1. Programming Language and Version
Language: COBOL
Version: The provided code is written in a standard COBOL syntax. The specific COBOL version is not mentioned.
2. Identification Division
Program Identification:
PROGRAM-ID. SampleProgram.: Specifies the name of the COBOL program.
Author and Date Information:
AUTHOR. Your Name.: Specifies the author of the program.
DATE-WRITTEN. Todays-Date.: Specifies the date when the program was written.
3. Data Division
Working Storage Section:
COUNTER: Numeric variable (3 digits) initialized to 1.
TOTAL-SUM: Numeric variable (5 digits) initialized to 0.
NUMBERS: Numeric array with 10 elements (3 digits each).
RESULT-MESSAGE: Alphanumeric variable with a maximum length of 50 characters.
4. Procedure Division
Procedure Division:
PERFORM INITIALIZE-DATA.: Calls a subroutine to initialize data.
PERFORM VARYING COUNTER FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL COUNTER > 10: Loop to compute the sum of elements in the NUMBERS array.
PERFORM DISPLAY-RESULTS.: Calls a subroutine to display results.
STOP RUN.: Ends the program.
5. Subroutine: INITIALIZE-DATA
Subroutine - INITIALIZE-DATA:
Initializes the NUMBERS array with specific values.
6. Subroutine: DISPLAY-RESULTS
Subroutine - DISPLAY-RESULTS:
Displays the result message and the total sum of numbers.
7. Conclusion
The COBOL program calculates the sum of predefined numbers and displays the result message. It follows a modular structure with a main procedure division and two subroutines for data initialization and result display. The program is well-organized and easy to understand.
