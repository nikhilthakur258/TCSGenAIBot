Test Scenarios:
Verify Basic PDF Structure:

Test Steps:
Open the generated PDF document.
Check that the PDF orientation is portrait ("P"), units are in inches, page dimensions are 4x2 inches, title is "Package Label 4x2," and margins are left: 0.1, right: 0, top: 0.1.
Check Barcode Content:

Test Steps:
Locate the CODE39 barcode in the PDF at coordinates (left: 0.15, top: 0.10).
Scan the barcode and ensure it displays the formatted ID as specified in the XML (e.g., "00000001").
Validate Barcode Font Style:

Identify the barcode font style in the PDF.
Confirm that the font style is Arial and bold.
Check Text Field for "Tracking No":

Locate the "Tracking No:" label in the PDF at coordinates (left: 0.12, top: 0.55).
Verify the font size is 6, style is bold, and font name is Arial.
Verify Tracking Number Data:

Test Steps:
Locate the tracking number field in the PDF at coordinates (left: 0.65, top: 0.55).
Confirm that the displayed tracking number matches the data from the XML (e.g., "1234567890").
Check that the font size is 6, style is bold, and font name is Arial.
Verify Data Prefix and Format:

Test Steps:
Check that the barcode data is formatted with leading zeros and matches the specified format ("%08d").
Test PDF Rendering:

Test Steps:
Open the PDF in Adobe Reader and another PDF viewer.
Check for consistent rendering across different viewers without any layout or formatting issues.
Boundary Testing:

Test Steps:
Test with the maximum allowed values for the barcode and tracking number.
Ensure the PDF handles large values without distortion.
Edge Cases:

Test Steps:
Test with an empty or null tracking number.
Confirm that the PDF handles this scenario gracefully without errors.
Compatibility Testing:

Test Steps:
Open the PDF in Adobe Reader, Foxit, and another PDF viewer.
Check for any compatibility issues or variations in rendering.
Regression Testing:

Test Steps:
After any modifications to the XML or PDF template, rerun all the above tests to ensure existing functionality is not impacted.
Verify Font Size and Style for Other Elements:
