Refined Requirements based on Industry Best Practices:

1. User Experience:

Upon accessing https://www.example.com using Chrome, users should seamlessly navigate through the application without encountering any unexpected issues.
2. File Upload Functionality:

Users clicking on "Upload Files" should experience a smooth process.
After uploading a 500KB spreadsheet ("500kb-sheet.xlsx"), the system should confirm successful completion.
Subsequent attempts to upload a 1MB spreadsheet ("1mb-sheet.xlsx") should result in a failure, preventing the file from being uploaded.
3. User Authentication:

Users accessing the login page and entering valid credentials ("testuser123" and "$Pass123") should successfully sign in.
Following authentication, the system should persistently display the previously uploaded 500KB spreadsheet ("500kb-sheet.xlsx") in the "Uploaded Files" table.
The system should not display the 1MB spreadsheet ("1mb-sheet.xlsx") in the "Uploaded Files" table.
4. Seamless Interaction After Authentication:

Users, after logging in, should experience an uninterrupted interaction with the application.
Clicking on "Spreadsheet Formats" should reveal the options "XLS" and "XLSX."
Subsequent attempts to upload the 1MB spreadsheet ("1mb-sheet.xlsx") should result in successful completion.
The "Uploaded Files" table should display both the 500KB ("500kb-sheet.xlsx") and 1MB ("1mb-sheet.xlsx") spreadsheets.
5. Best Practices Adherence:

The application should adhere to general best practices, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
Any changes in the application should not adversely affect the seamless execution of the described user interactions.
Error messages, if any, should be clear and provide actionable information for users.
6. Responsive User Interface:

The user interface should respond promptly to user actions, providing a positive and efficient experience.
Buttons, such as "XLS" and "XLSX," should be visible and accessible as expected.
7. System Stability:

The application should remain stable and functional, even during complex user interactions such as file uploads and authentication.
8. Maintenance and Documentation:

Regularly review and update the application to align with industry standards and user expectations.
Maintain detailed documentation for any deviations from expected behavior, improvements, or potential defects for future reference.
